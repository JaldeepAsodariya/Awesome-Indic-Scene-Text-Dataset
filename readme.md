# Introduction

Scene Text Detection and Recognition is an active area of research. It is popularized through the launch of the **Robust Reading Competition** by ICDAR. Since its initialization in 2003, competition has been held again in 2005, 2011, 2013, 2015 and in the year of 2017.
But, dataset introduced in the competition is mainly focused on English language and limited in size (Until the introduction of MS-COCO-Text).
And such dataset does not suit Indian Environment which is very diverse in sense of language. So, we are starting this project to collect quality Indic Text Images in large quantity, so that they can be further annotated and converted into the well-defined dataset, which can be publicly available.

## Application


Detecting text in photographs has various applications like **It can help blind in mundane activities like locating an object in their surrounding, which can further assist them in shopping in the mall, in knowing the name of a product and other pieces of information**.

Similarly, text in the photograph when translated to a particular language can be of great help to a foreign as well as local tourist, since India is a diverse country and here languages changes from state to state. It can help them in navigate, purchase stuff and explore shops without language as a barrier.
